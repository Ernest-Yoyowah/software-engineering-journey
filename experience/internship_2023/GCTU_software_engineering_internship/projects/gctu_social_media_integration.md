# GCTU University Social Media Integration

## Overview

During my Software Engineering Internship at GCTU, I collaborated closely with my boss, the webmaster, who requested and integrated the project into the official GCTU website. I successfully developed and handed over the social media integration, allowing the university to dynamically showcase its latest updates from Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube directly on the website.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript
- Social Media APIs (Twitter, Facebook, Youtube)

## Achievements

- Seamless integration of Twitter timelines, Facebook page plugin, and Youtube videos.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
- Improved user engagement by bringing real-time social media updates to the university website.
