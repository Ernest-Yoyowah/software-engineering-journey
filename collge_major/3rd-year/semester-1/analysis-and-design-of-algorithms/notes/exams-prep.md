# Topics in Analysis and Design of Algorithms

## 1. **Algorithm Complexity**
### Explanation
Algorithm complexity measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time (time complexity) and space (space complexity). It is typically expressed using Big-O notation.

### Code Example
```python
# Calculate time complexity of a loop
def print_numbers(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)
# Time complexity: O(n)

## 2. **Sorting Algorithms**

### Explanation

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order (ascending or descending). Examples include Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

### Code Example

```python
# Merge Sort Implementation
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left = arr[:mid]
        right = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left)
        merge_sort(right)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                arr[k] = left[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left):
            arr[k] = left[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right):
            arr[k] = right[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
merge_sort(arr)
print(arr)
```

## 3. **Search Algorithms**

### Explanation

Search algorithms locate specific elements in a data structure. Examples include Linear Search, Binary Search, and Depth-First Search (DFS).

### Code Example

```python
# Binary Search Implementation
def binary_search(arr, x):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]
x = 10
print(binary_search(arr, x))
```

## 4. **Dynamic Programming**

### Explanation

Dynamic Programming (DP) solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems. It stores the results of sub-problems to avoid redundant computations.

### Code Example

```python
# Fibonacci using Dynamic Programming
def fibonacci(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]

print(fibonacci(10))
```

## 5. **Greedy Algorithms**

### Explanation

Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping to find the global optimum.

### Code Example

```python
# Coin Change Problem using Greedy Approach
def min_coins(coins, amount):
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    count = 0
    for coin in coins:
        count += amount // coin
        amount %= coin
    return count

coins = [1, 2, 5, 10]
amount = 27
print(min_coins(coins, amount))
```

## 6. **Divide and Conquer**

### Explanation

Divide and Conquer splits a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves each recursively, and combines the results.

### Code Example

```python
# Example: Maximum Subarray Sum using Divide and Conquer
def max_subarray_sum(arr, left, right):
    if left == right:
        return arr[left]

    mid = (left + right) // 2
    left_sum = max_subarray_sum(arr, left, mid)
    right_sum = max_subarray_sum(arr, mid + 1, right)

    cross_sum = cross_max_sum(arr, left, mid, right)
    return max(left_sum, right_sum, cross_sum)

def cross_max_sum(arr, left, mid, right):
    left_max, right_max = float('-inf'), float('-inf')
    temp_sum = 0

    for i in range(mid, left - 1, -1):
        temp_sum += arr[i]
        left_max = max(left_max, temp_sum)

    temp_sum = 0
    for i in range(mid + 1, right + 1):
        temp_sum += arr[i]
        right_max = max(right_max, temp_sum)

    return left_max + right_max

arr = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
print(max_subarray_sum(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1))
```

---

## 7. **Graph Algorithms**

### Explanation

Graph algorithms are used to analyze and process graph structures. Examples include BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

### Code Example

```python
# Breadth-First Search (BFS)
def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = [start]

    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node not in visited:
            print(node, end=" ")
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(graph[node] - visited)

graph = {
    'A': {'B', 'C'},
    'B': {'A', 'D', 'E'},
    'C': {'A', 'F'},
    'D': {'B'},
    'E': {'B', 'F'},
    'F': {'C', 'E'},
}
bfs(graph, 'A')
```

## 8. **Backtracking**

### Explanation

Backtracking solves problems by trying all possible solutions and removing those that fail constraints.

### Code Example

```python
# N-Queens Problem
def solve_n_queens(n):
    def is_safe(board, row, col):
        for i in range(row):
            if board[i][col] == 1 or (col - (row - i) >= 0 and board[i][col - (row - i)] == 1) or (col + (row - i) < n and board[i][col + (row - i)] == 1):
                return False
        return True

    def solve(board, row):
        if row == n:
            result.append([row[:] for row in board])
            return
        for col in range(n):
            if is_safe(board, row, col):
                board[row][col] = 1
                solve(board, row + 1)
                board[row][col] = 0

    result = []
    board = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    solve(board, 0)
    return result

print(solve_n_queens(4))
```

---

## 9. **Recursion**

### Explanation

Recursion involves solving a problem by defining it in terms of itself. Base cases prevent infinite recursion.

### Code Example

```python
# Factorial Using Recursion
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))
```
