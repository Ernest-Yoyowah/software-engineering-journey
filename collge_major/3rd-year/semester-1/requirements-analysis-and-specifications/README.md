# Requirements Gathering and Specification

---

## What This Course is About

Requirements Gathering and Specification focuses on understanding what stakeholders need from a software system. This involves identifying, documenting, and managing requirements to ensure the final product meets its intended goals.

### Key Concepts:

- **Stakeholders**: Identifying everyone impacted by the system.
- **Requirements**: Functional (what the system does) and non-functional (performance, scalability, etc.).
- **Elicitation Techniques**: Methods to gather requirements (interviews, surveys, observations).
- **Documentation**: Using tools like Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
- **Validation**: Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible.
- **Change Management**: Handling evolving requirements during development.
