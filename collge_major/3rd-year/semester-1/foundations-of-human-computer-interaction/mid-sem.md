# Usability and HCI Questions and Answers

## 1. What is the primary goal of Usability Engineering?

- **Answer**: **b. To ensure the effectiveness and user-friendliness of a product through user involvement.**
- **Explanation**: The main goal of usability engineering is to ensure that a product is effective, efficient, and satisfying to use. This involves continuous user feedback and iteration throughout the design and development process to meet user needs.

## 2. Usability evaluation methods include all of the following except:

- **Answer**: **d. Surveys**
- **Explanation**: Usability evaluation methods typically include heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability testing, but surveys, while useful for gathering user opinions, are not directly classified as usability evaluation methods.

## 3. According to the user design principles, what is the goal of HCI design guidelines for data entry?

- **Answer**: **d. To reduce the number of input actions required of the user.**
- **Explanation**: The goal is to streamline the process of data entry to make it as efficient and user-friendly as possible, reducing the burden on users by minimizing the number of steps or actions they need to take.

## 4. The "Learnability" criterion in usability assessment evaluates:

- **Answer**: **c. How effectively users can use the system for the first time.**
- **Explanation**: Learnability measures how easy it is for users to learn how to use a system when they first encounter it. It focuses on how quickly new users can become proficient with the interface.

## 5. Which HCI guideline focuses on ensuring that actions can be reversed easily?

- **Answer**: **c. Permit easy reversal of actions**
- **Explanation**: This guideline emphasizes that users should be able to undo their actions easily, reducing the potential for errors and giving users the confidence to explore the system without fear of making irreversible mistakes.

## 6. What is the first of Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules for interface design?

- **Answer**: **b. Strive for Consistency**
- **Explanation**: The first rule in Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules focuses on consistency in design. Consistent interfaces help users recognize patterns and reduce the cognitive load required to understand how to interact with the system.

## 7. Usability Engineering involves:

- **Answer**: **d. Ensuring product effectiveness through user input from the beginning**
- **Explanation**: Usability engineering is about creating products that are effective, efficient, and satisfying to use, which requires ongoing user involvement from the early stages of design.

## 8. What is chunking primarily used for memory and how does it help in interface design?

- **Answer**: **c. Organizing information into units**
- **Explanation**: Chunking is a technique where information is grouped into smaller, more manageable units. This helps reduce cognitive load and aids in memory retention, making it easier for users to process and recall information.

## 9. In HCI, what does the term "memorability" refer to?

- **Answer**: **d. How well users can recall how to use the system after a period of inactivity.**
- **Explanation**: Memorability refers to how easily users can remember how to use a system after not using it for a while. A good system should allow users to quickly reacquaint themselves with its interface without needing to relearn everything.

## 10. Which HCI design category includes guidelines related to data entry?

- **Answer**: **b. Data Entry**
- **Explanation**: The Data Entry category in HCI design focuses on the usability of the system's input methods, ensuring that data can be entered accurately and efficiently by users.

## 11. What usability principle emphasizes presenting only relevant information based on the current context?

- **Answer**: **b. Exhibit only applicable information**
- **Explanation**: This principle suggests that only the information relevant to the user's current task or context should be displayed, reducing clutter and helping users focus on what's important at that moment.

## 12. What does the "Satisfaction" criterion in usability assessment measure?

- **Answer**: **b. How pleased or content users are with their overall experience**
- **Explanation**: Satisfaction measures the user's emotional response to the system. It assesses how happy or content users are with their overall experience, including factors such as comfort and enjoyment.

## 13. Which usability criteria assesses how efficiently users can perform tasks within the system?

- **Answer**: **a. Efficiency**
- **Explanation**: Efficiency measures how quickly and effectively users can complete tasks after learning the system. A more efficient system reduces the time and effort required to complete tasks.

## 14. Which process involves constantly using information gathered through the senses and information stored in memory?

- **Answer**: **c. Top-down processing**
- **Explanation**: Top-down processing refers to the use of prior knowledge, expectations, and memory to interpret and make sense of sensory information, allowing us to process and understand new inputs more quickly.

## 15. Which technique involves connecting things to be remembered with specific words, such as "one-bun"?

- **Answer**: **d. Pegword method**
- **Explanation**: The Pegword method is a mnemonic technique where items to be remembered are linked with specific words or images that serve as mental "pegs." For example, associating numbers with rhyming words like "one-bun."

## 16. Which usability criterion emphasizes reducing the number of input actions required of the user?

- **Answer**: **d. Reduce the number of input actions required of the user**
- **Explanation**: This criterion suggests minimizing the number of steps or actions users must take during input processes to make interactions more efficient and user-friendly.

## 17. Which principle suggests that not all processing capacity of the mental system is available at all times?

- **Answer**: **c. Limited processing capacity**
- **Explanation**: The principle of limited processing capacity refers to the fact that humans can only process a certain amount of information at once. This limitation impacts how well users can focus on tasks and make decisions based on available information.

## 18. Who consolidated eight general guidelines for designing, differentiating good interface design from bad?

- **Answer**: **c. Ben Shneiderman**
- **Explanation**: Ben Shneiderman developed the Eight Golden Rules for interface design, which help distinguish good user interface design from bad by providing practical guidelines for creating effective and user-friendly systems.

## 19. Which guideline advises using standard labels, abbreviations, and colors to improve information display?

- **Answer**: **c. Use standard labels, standard abbreviations, and probable colors.**
- **Explanation**: This guideline suggests that using consistent labels, abbreviations, and colors that users are familiar with helps make information clearer and easier to understand.

## 20. Which principle suggests that not all processing capacity of the mental system is available at all times?

- **Answer**: **c. Limited processing capacity**
- **Explanation**: This principle suggests that human cognitive resources are finite. At any given moment, people can only process a limited amount of information, which affects their ability to multitask or focus on complex tasks.
