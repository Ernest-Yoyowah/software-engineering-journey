# Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice

The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice was developed by ACM and IEEE-CS to guide the behavior of software engineers and ensure ethical conduct in the profession. It is divided into eight key principles:

## 1. Public

Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest. This includes ensuring that their work benefits society and avoids causing harm, ensuring safety, and promoting the common good.

## 2. Client and Employer

Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interest of their client and employer, consistent with the public interest. They should be honest about the capabilities and limitations of their software, avoid conflicts of interest, and respect confidentiality.

## 3. Product

Software engineers shall ensure that their products meet the highest professional standards possible. This includes designing high-quality software, thoroughly testing it, and documenting processes appropriately.

## 4. Judgment

Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment. They must avoid making decisions based on pressure or external influences and instead focus on technical and ethical correctness.

## 5. Management

Software engineering managers and leaders shall promote an ethical approach to software development and maintenance. This includes providing resources for ethical decision-making, ensuring that policies are in place, and guiding their teams in adhering to ethical standards.

## 6. Profession

Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession. They must work to improve their knowledge and skills, be honest in their professional dealings, and share their expertise with others in the field.

## 7. Colleagues

Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues. This involves creating a positive work environment, encouraging knowledge sharing, giving credit where itâ€™s due, and treating others with respect.

## 8. Self

Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession. They should continuously strive to improve their skills and knowledge.

By adhering to these principles, software engineers contribute to a profession that is both ethical and responsible, ensuring the safety, well-being, and development of the public and their professional peers.
