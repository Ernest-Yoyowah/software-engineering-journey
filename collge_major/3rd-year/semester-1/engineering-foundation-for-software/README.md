# Engineering Foundations for Software

## Key Areas to Focus on for "Engineering Foundation of Software"

### 1. Software Engineering vs. Software Development

- **Software Engineering**: A systematic, disciplined approach to the design, development, and maintenance of software.
- **Software Development**: The practical aspect of building software (coding, testing, etc.).

### 2. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- **Stages**: Requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance.
- **Models**: Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, V-Model.
- **Focus**: Understanding how software moves from conception to release.

### 3. Engineering Processes and Methodologies

- **Agile Methodology**: Focus on iterative development, flexibility, client collaboration.
- **Waterfall Model**: Linear approach, each phase depends on the previous.
- **Scrum and Kanban**: Agile frameworks for managing and organizing projects.

### 4. Requirements Engineering

- Importance of gathering and analyzing **software requirements**.
- **Functional requirements**: What the system does.
- **Non-functional requirements**: Performance, scalability, security.

### 5. Quality Assurance and Testing

- **Software Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, acceptance tests.
- **Verification vs. Validation**: Verification checks if the product was built correctly; validation checks if the correct product was built.

### 6. Version Control and Collaboration Tools

- **Git**: Learn basic version control concepts (commits, branches, merges).
- **Collaboration**: Tools like GitHub or GitLab to manage codebases and handle team collaboration.

### 7. Software Metrics and Measurements

- Understanding metrics to evaluate software quality, maintainability, and performance.
- Examples: Code coverage, cyclomatic complexity, performance metrics.

### 8. Risk Management in Software Engineering

- **Identifying risks**: Technical, project, and business risks.
- **Risk mitigation**: Strategies for handling risks early in the development process.

## Recommended Preparation for the First Class

1. **Understand the SDLC**: Grasp the stages involved in software creation.
2. **Explore Agile and Waterfall Models**: Learn their differences and applications.
3. **Read about Requirements Engineering**: Why requirements are critical to success.
4. **Explore Git**: Get familiar with basic version control commands like committing and pushing code.

## What to Expect in the First Class

- **Introduction to Software Engineering**: Its purpose and importance.
- **Overview of SDLC**: A look at the software development process.
- **Introduction to Methodologies**: Agile, Waterfall, etc.
- **Basic Tools**: Expect an introduction to tools like Git for version control.
