# Software Design Course Preparation Guide

## Course Information

---

**Aim of the Course:**  
This course provides students with the principles and techniques to design modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems, while understanding best practices in software architecture and design.

### Course Topics:

1. **Introduction to Software Design:**

   - Definition and importance of software design.
   - Overview of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and where design fits in.

2. **Object-Oriented Design (OOD):**

   - Key principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
   - Designing with OOP principles using UML (Unified Modeling Language).

3. **Software Design Patterns:**

   - Understanding reusable design solutions.
   - Common design patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, and MVC (Model-View-Controller).

4. **System Modeling:**

   - Use of UML diagrams for software architecture.
   - Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams.

5. **Agile and Adaptive Software Design:**

   - Agile principles and their impact on software design.
   - Adaptive design practices for changing requirements.

6. **Software Architecture:**

   - Architectural patterns (e.g., Layered Architecture, Microservices).
   - Balancing trade-offs between different architectures.

7. **User Interface Design in Software:**

   - Principles of designing effective, user-friendly interfaces.
   - Incorporating usability into the design process.

8. **Database Design Integration:**

   - Designing efficient database schemas.
   - Ensuring database and software design are cohesive.

9. **System Implementation:**

   - Transitioning from design to code.
   - Best practices for implementing design patterns.

10. **Software Testing and Validation:**

    - Designing software for testability.
    - Methods for ensuring software functions as intended.

11. **Software Maintenance and Evolution:**
    - Designing for scalability and maintainability.
    - Techniques for adapting software to future needs and updates.

## Difference Between Software Design and Software Architecture:

- **Software Design:** Focuses on defining how the individual components of the software system will function.
- **Software Architecture:** Concentrates on the overall structure of the system and how the components fit together.

### Major Components of Software Design:

1. **Requirements Gathering:**

   - Understanding the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.

2. **High-Level Design:**

   - Developing the architectural view of the system and defining how components interact.

3. **Detailed Design:**

   - Specifying the individual components and their interaction in more detail.

4. **Design Patterns:**

   - Applying well-established solutions to common design problems.

5. **Design for Testing:**

   - Ensuring that the design is testable and adaptable to future testing strategies.

6. **Design Documentation:**
   - Documenting the design for implementation and maintenance teams.
