Difference Between Software Architecture and Software Design

1. From Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob, i understand the goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to develop and maintain a software system. "The measure of design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to
   meet the needs of the customer. If that effort is low, and stays low throughout
   the lifetime of the system, the design is good. If that effort grows with each
   new release, the design is bad. Itâ€™s as simple as that." - from the book
