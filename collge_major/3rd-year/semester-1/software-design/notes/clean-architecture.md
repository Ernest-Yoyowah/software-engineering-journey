# Difference Between Software Architecture and Software Design

## Key Concepts

### Software Architecture

- **Goal**: Minimize the human resources required to develop and maintain a software system over its lifetime.
- **Focus**: High-level structure, including decisions about frameworks, libraries, modules, and interactions between components.
- **Measure of Quality**: The ability to evolve and adapt the system with minimal effort. A good architecture enables easy changes while maintaining stability.
- **Reference Insight**:
  - From _Clean Architecture_ by Uncle Bob:
    > "The measure of design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to meet the needs of the customer. If that effort is low, and stays low throughout the lifetime of the system, the design is good. If that effort grows with each new release, the design is bad. It’s as simple as that."

### Software Design

- **Goal**: Solve specific problems or implement specific features within the constraints of the architecture.
- **Focus**: Lower-level concerns such as algorithms, data structures, and class hierarchies.
- **Measure of Quality**: Clarity, simplicity, and how well the design adheres to established best practices.

## Action Points

1. Extract practical definitions and examples of **architecture** and **design** from _Clean Architecture_.
2. Compare and contrast their purposes and scopes with real-world scenarios.
3. Reflect on how a system’s **architecture** impacts its **design**, and vice versa.

## Additional Notes

- While architecture deals with the "what" and "why" at a system level, design focuses on the "how" at a granular level.
- A well-designed system supports the goals of its architecture, while poor design can undermine even the best architecture.
