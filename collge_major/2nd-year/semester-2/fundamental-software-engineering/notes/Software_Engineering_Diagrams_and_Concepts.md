# Software Engineering Diagrams and Concepts

## 1. Non-Functional Requirements Diagram

**Definition:**
Non-functional requirements specify criteria that judge the operation of a system, such as performance, usability, reliability, and security. Unlike functional requirements, which describe what the system should do, non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform.

**Diagram Expectations:**

- **Performance:** Requirements like response time and throughput.
- **Scalability:** How well the system scales with increasing load.
- **Reliability:** System uptime and fault tolerance.
- **Usability:** Criteria for user interaction and ease of use.
- **Security:** Specifications for data protection and access control.

**Example:**
A non-functional requirements diagram might use boxes or lists to show different aspects of non-functional requirements and their specific criteria.

## 2. User and System Requirements

**Definition:**

- **User Requirements:** High-level expectations from the user, written in user-friendly language.
- **System Requirements:** Detailed technical specifications of how the system should function to meet user requirements.

**Diagram Expectations:**

- **User Requirements Diagram:** High-level representation showing user interactions and expectations.
- **System Requirements Diagram:** Detailed, including specific use cases, system processes, and interactions.

**Example:**
A user requirements diagram might show a user interacting with different parts of the system, while a system requirements diagram could include detailed process flows or system components.

## 3. Use Case Diagrams

**Definition:**
Use case diagrams depict the functional requirements of a system by showing the interactions between users (actors) and the system itself.

**Diagram Expectations:**

- **Actors:** Represent users or other systems interacting with the system.
- **Use Cases:** Represent functional requirements or actions performed by the system.
- **Relationships:** Show interactions, including associations, generalizations, and dependencies.

**Example:**
A use case diagram might include actors like "Customer" and "Admin," with use cases like "Place Order" and "Generate Report," illustrating how these actors interact with system functions.

## 4. Weather Information Systems

**Definition:**
These systems collect, analyze, and provide weather-related data, such as temperature, humidity, and forecasts.

**Diagram Expectations:**

- **System Architecture:** Diagrams showing data flow from sources (sensors) to processing units and output (user interfaces).
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD):** Illustrates how data moves through the system, including collection, processing, and presentation.

**Example:**
A weather information system diagram might include components like "Weather Sensors," "Data Processing Unit," and "User Dashboard," with arrows indicating data flow.

## 5. Principles of Agile Method

**Definition:**
Agile methodology emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change.

**Principles:**

- **Customer Collaboration:** Engage with the customer throughout development.
- **Iterative Development:** Develop software in small, manageable increments.
- **Responding to Change:** Adapt to changes in requirements even late in the process.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Deliver working software frequently.
- **Cross-functional Teams:** Teams should include all necessary skills to deliver the product.

**Example:**
A visual representation of Agile principles might include a cycle or iteration chart showing continuous feedback loops and iterative progress.

## 6. Stakeholders for a System

**Definition:**
Stakeholders are individuals or groups with an interest in or affected by the system.

**Types of Stakeholders:**

- **Primary Stakeholders:** Directly interact with the system (e.g., end-users, customers).
- **Secondary Stakeholders:** Indirectly affected (e.g., support staff, management).
- **External Stakeholders:** Outside the organization but affected (e.g., regulatory bodies, partners).

**Diagram Expectations:**

- **Stakeholder Map:** Identifies stakeholders and their relationships to the system.
- **Stakeholder Analysis Diagram:** Shows influence and interest levels of each stakeholder.

**Example:**
A stakeholder map might include circles or boxes for each stakeholder group, with lines indicating their level of interaction or influence on the system.
