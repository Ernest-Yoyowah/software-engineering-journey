# Fundamental Software Engineering - Major Topics

## 1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- **Phases**: Requirements gathering, design, implementation or Development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- **Models**: Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and DevOps.

## 2. Software Requirements Engineering

- **Requirements Gathering**: Techniques for eliciting requirements from stakeholders.
- **Types of Requirements**: Functional vs. non-functional requirements.
- **Requirement Specifications**: Creating clear and unambiguous documentation.

## 3. Software Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Designing systems as a collection of smaller, independent modules.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on high-level functionalities.
- **Design Patterns**: Common solutions to recurring design problems (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).

## 4. Software Architecture

- **Architectural Styles**: Layered architecture, microservices, client-server, and event-driven.
- **Designing Architecture**: Principles and best practices for designing robust and scalable software systems.

## 5. Software Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Types of Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing.
- **Testing Strategies**: Test-driven development (TDD), behavior-driven development (BDD).
- **Quality Metrics**: Measuring software quality through various metrics like code coverage and defect density.

## 6. Version Control and Configuration Management

- **Version Control Systems**: Understanding tools like Git for managing source code.
- **Branching and Merging**: Strategies for managing multiple development streams.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating the testing and deployment process.

## 7. Software Project Management

- **Project Planning**: Estimating time and resources, creating schedules.
- **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating potential risks in a project.
- **Agile Methodologies**: Understanding Scrum, Kanban, and other Agile frameworks.

## 8. Software Maintenance and Evolution

- **Types of Maintenance**: Corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance.
- **Legacy Systems**: Managing and evolving existing software systems.
- **Refactoring**: Improving code structure without changing its functionality.

## 9. Software Metrics and Estimation

- **Effort Estimation**: Techniques like Function Point Analysis, COCOMO model.
- **Software Metrics**: Lines of code (LOC), cyclomatic complexity, and others to assess the quality and productivity of software.

## 10. Software Process Models

- **Waterfall Model**: Linear sequential model.
- **Agile Models**: Iterative models focusing on flexibility and customer collaboration.
- **Spiral Model**: Combining iterative development with risk management.

## 11. Ethics in Software Engineering

- **Code of Ethics**: Understanding the ethical responsibilities of software engineers.
- **Professional Practices**: Ensuring privacy, security, and fairness in software development.

## 12. Emerging Trends in Software Engineering

- **DevOps**: Integrating development and operations for faster delivery.
- **Microservices**: Designing software as a collection of small, independent services.
- **AI and Machine Learning in Software Engineering**: Incorporating AI-driven approaches in development and testing.

## 13. Software Documentation

- **Technical Documentation**: Writing clear and comprehensive documentation for different audiences (developers, users).
- **API Documentation**: Documenting application programming interfaces (APIs) for easier integration and use.

## 14. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

- **User-Centered Design**: Creating software with the user’s needs in mind.
- **Usability Testing**: Techniques for evaluating software from the user’s perspective.
