# End of Semester Expectations: Database Management Systems (DBMS)

At the end of the semester, students are expected to have a comprehensive understanding of the following key concepts and skills related to Database Management Systems (DBMS):

## 1. Fundamental Concepts

- **Understanding of DBMS**: Clear understanding of what a Database Management System is, its architecture, and its role in managing data.
- **Data Models**: Familiarity with different data models, particularly the relational model and the Entity-Relationship (ER) model.

## 2. Database Design

- **ER Diagrams**: Ability to create Entity-Relationship diagrams to model data and define relationships between entities.
- **Normalization**: Proficiency in normalizing database schemas to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity (up to at least 3NF).
- **Database Schema Design**: Ability to design logical and physical database schemas that effectively organize data.

## 3. SQL Proficiency

- **Basic SQL Queries**: Ability to write SQL queries for data retrieval (SELECT), data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and data definition (CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
- **Advanced SQL**: Proficiency in writing complex SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregation functions.
- **Query Optimization**: Understanding how to optimize SQL queries for better performance.

## 4. Transaction Management

- **ACID Properties**: Clear understanding of the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and their importance in transaction management.
- **Concurrency Control**: Knowledge of techniques to manage concurrent transactions and ensure data consistency.
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Understanding of recovery techniques to restore databases after failures.

## 5. Database Security

- **Access Control**: Knowledge of how to implement and manage access controls to protect database resources.
- **Encryption and Privacy**: Understanding of data encryption methods and best practices for ensuring data privacy.

## 6. Hands-on Experience

- **Practical Application**: Experience in designing, implementing, and managing databases through practical projects.
- **SQL Coding**: Proficiency in writing and debugging SQL code to solve real-world database problems.
- **Database Management**: Ability to manage database performance, including indexing and query optimization.

## 7. Exposure to NoSQL

- **Introduction to NoSQL**: Basic understanding of NoSQL databases, their use cases, and how they differ from relational databases.

By the end of the semester, students should be able to design efficient databases, write and optimize SQL queries, and manage databases effectively, laying a solid foundation for advanced study or careers in database management.
