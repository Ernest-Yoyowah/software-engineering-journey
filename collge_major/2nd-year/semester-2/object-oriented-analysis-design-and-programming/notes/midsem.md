#### Case Study: A Point of Sale Application for a Supermarket

The owner of Owuscobee Supermarket in Abetifi wants their current Point of Sale Application upgraded.

**Description:**  
A Point of Sale (POS) application is software designed to facilitate sales transactions, manage inventory, process payments, and perform other functions related to retail or hospitality businesses.

**Problem:**  
The current system is unable to track daily sales and produce daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports for the owner. Additionally, the owner is unable to identify which employee sold which products and the total amount involved.

In view of the above problem, the owner wants the following upgrades:

1. **Sales Processing:**  
   The POS application should allow users to ring up sales transactions by scanning barcodes, selecting items from a list, or manually entering product information. It calculates the total amount due, applies discounts or promotions, and generates receipts for customers.

2. **Inventory Management:**  
   The system should have inventory management functionality that enables users to track the quantity of products in stock, receive new shipments, update inventory levels, and set up reorder points for automatic replenishment.

3. **Product Catalog:**  
   The POS application should have a product catalog component that stores information about the products available for sale, including product names, descriptions, prices, categories, and images. It may also support variations such as sizes, colors, and styles for each product.

4. **Payment Processing:**  
   The system should include payment processing functionality to handle various forms of payment, including cash, credit/debit cards, mobile payments, gift cards, and split payments. It verifies payment information, authorizes transactions, and generates receipts.

5. **Customer Management:**  
   The POS application should include customer management features that allow the business to store customer information, such as names, contact details, purchase history, and loyalty program memberships. This information can be used to personalize marketing efforts and provide better service.

6. **Reporting and Analytics:**  
   The POS application should include reporting and analytics tools that provide insights into sales performance, inventory levels, product trends, and other key metrics. Users can generate reports, charts, and graphs to analyze data and make informed business decisions.

7. **Employee Management:**  
   The system should provide employee management functionality for tracking employee hours, managing permissions and access levels, and generating payroll reports. It may also include tools for scheduling shifts and managing time-off requests.

8. **Integration Interfaces:**  
   The POS application should integrate with other systems such as accounting software, e-commerce platforms, loyalty programs, and third-party payment processors. Integration interfaces enable data sharing and synchronization between different systems.

9. **Security Features:**  
   The system should provide security features to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to the system. This may include user authentication, encryption of data transmissions, compliance with PCI-DSS standards for payment processing, and regular security updates.

10. **Customization and Configuration:**  
    The POS application should offer options for customization and configuration to adapt the system to the specific needs and workflows of each business. Users can customize settings, layouts, and workflows to optimize efficiency and usability.

#### Task: Perform Object-Oriented Analysis

Using the above information from the problem domain, perform the following analysis:

1. **Identify Object Classes**

   - Identify at least 5 object classes.

2. **Attributes and Methods**

   - Provide at least 3 attributes and 3 methods for each class.

3. **Establish Relationships**

   - Establish relationships between the classes. The relationships should include inheritance (generalization/specialization), association, and aggregation/composition.

4. **Class Diagram**

   - Construct a Class Diagram to visualize the above analysis.

5. **Program Development**

   - Using either Java or C++ as a programming language, develop a program that includes the classes identified in (1) above.

6. **Object-Oriented Concepts Demonstration**
   - Demonstrate the implementation of the following Object-Oriented concepts in your program:
     - Polymorphism
     - Inheritance
     - Encapsulation
     - Abstraction

> **Note:** You may use Draw.io or Microsoft Visio to create the UML Class Diagram.
