# End of Semester Expectations: Operating Systems

As the semester concludes, students are expected to have a solid understanding of the following key concepts and skills related to Operating Systems (OS):

## 1. Fundamental Concepts of OS

- **Definition and Purpose**: Understand the role of an OS in managing hardware and software resources.
- **Types of Operating Systems**: Familiarity with different types of OS, such as batch, time-sharing, distributed, and real-time systems.

## 2. Process Management

- **Processes and Threads**: Ability to define, create, and manage processes and threads, including understanding process states, lifecycle, and inter-process communication (IPC).
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Knowledge of different CPU scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling) and their use cases.
- **Synchronization**: Understanding of synchronization mechanisms like semaphores, mutexes, and monitors to handle concurrency and avoid deadlocks.

## 3. Memory Management

- **Memory Allocation**: Comprehend techniques for memory allocation, including dynamic allocation and fragmentation management.
- **Paging and Segmentation**: Understanding of paging and segmentation techniques for memory management and how virtual memory works.
- **Memory Protection**: Awareness of how the OS protects memory to prevent unauthorized access and ensure process isolation.

## 4. File Systems

- **File Management**: Ability to describe how files are organized, stored, and managed, including understanding file permissions and access controls.
- **Directory Structures**: Knowledge of different directory structures (e.g., single-level, two-level, tree-structured) and their advantages and disadvantages.
- **File System Implementation**: Understanding the principles behind file system implementation, including file allocation methods, free space management, and file system consistency.

## 5. Input/Output (I/O) Management

- **I/O Devices**: Familiarity with various I/O devices and how the OS manages their operations.
- **I/O Scheduling**: Understanding of I/O scheduling algorithms and techniques for optimizing I/O operations.
- **Device Drivers**: Basic knowledge of how device drivers interact with the OS and hardware.

## 6. Security and Protection

- **OS Security**: Awareness of security principles in OS, including user authentication, access control mechanisms, and encryption.
- **Threats and Countermeasures**: Understanding of common security threats (e.g., viruses, worms, malware) and OS-level countermeasures.

## 7. Virtualization

- **Virtual Machines**: Comprehend the concept of virtualization and how the OS supports the creation and management of virtual machines.
- **Hypervisors**: Understanding the role of hypervisors in virtualization and their types (Type 1 and Type 2).

## 8. System Calls and OS Services

- **System Calls**: Ability to describe and utilize system calls as the interface between the OS and application programs.
- **OS Services**: Understanding the various services provided by the OS, such as file management, process management, memory management, and security services.

## 9. Performance Evaluation

- **Metrics and Measurement**: Familiarity with metrics for evaluating OS performance, such as throughput, turnaround time, and response time.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Knowledge of techniques to optimize OS performance, including memory optimization, CPU scheduling, and I/O management.

## 10. Practical Applications

- **Hands-on Experience**: Practical experience with OS concepts through lab exercises, such as writing simple shell scripts, implementing scheduling algorithms, or simulating memory management techniques.
- **Real-world Applications**: Understanding how OS concepts apply to real-world systems, such as cloud computing, mobile operating systems, and distributed systems.

By the end of the semester, you should have a comprehensive understanding of these topics, enabling you to analyze, design, and optimize operating systems and develop software that effectively interacts with the OS.
