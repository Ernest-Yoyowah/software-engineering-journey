### Define the term "scripting language" and provide two examples of popular scripting languages.

A scripting language is a high-level programming language that is interpreted or compiled at runtime, rather than beforehand. Scripting languages are often used for rapid prototyping, development, and deployment of applications, and are commonly used for web development, system administration, and game development.

Two popular scripting languages are:

- Python: Known for its simplicity, readability, and large standard library, Python is a popular choice for web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
- JavaScript: Known for its ubiquity in web development, JavaScript is used for client-side scripting, creating interactive web pages, and developing desktop and mobile applications.

### Explain the difference between a scripting language and a programming language, providing examples to illustrate your points.

A scripting language is a type of programming language that is interpreted or compiled at runtime, rather than beforehand. Programming languages, on the other hand, are compiled beforehand and executed directly by the computer's processor.

Scripting languages are often used for rapid prototyping, development, and deployment of applications, and are commonly used for web development, system administration, and game development. Examples of scripting languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

Programming languages, on the other hand, are often used for developing operating systems, embedded systems, and other low-level applications that require direct access to hardware resources. Examples of programming languages include C, C++, and Java.

In summary, scripting languages are high-level, interpreted or compiled at runtime, and are often used for rapid prototyping and development, while programming languages are low-level, compiled beforehand, and are often used for developing operating systems and embedded systems.
