# OSI vs. TCP/IP Models and Their Protocols

## OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a theoretical framework used to understand and design network protocols. It divides the communication process into seven distinct layers.

### OSI Layers and Protocols

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**

   - **Function:** Transmits raw bitstreams over physical media.
   - **Protocols/Technologies:** Ethernet (cabling and hardware), Fiber Optics, Hubs, Repeaters.

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**

   - **Function:** Provides error detection, correction, and framing for data packets.
   - **Protocols:** Ethernet, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), Frame Relay, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**

   - **Function:** Handles routing, addressing, and packet forwarding.
   - **Protocols:** IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), RIP (Routing Information Protocol).

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**

   - **Function:** Manages end-to-end communication, flow control, and error recovery.
   - **Protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**

   - **Function:** Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications.
   - **Protocols:** NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call), PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol).

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**

   - **Function:** Translates data formats between the application layer and network.
   - **Protocols:** SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), JPEG, GIF, MPEG.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
   - **Function:** Provides network services directly to end-users and applications.
   - **Protocols:** HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System).

## TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a practical framework used for internet and network communication. It consists of four layers.

### TCP/IP Layers and Protocols

1. **Link Layer (Network Interface Layer)**

   - **Function:** Handles the physical and data link aspects of network communication.
   - **Protocols:** Ethernet, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), Wi-Fi.

2. **Internet Layer**

   - **Function:** Manages logical addressing and routing of packets across networks.
   - **Protocols:** IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol).

3. **Transport Layer**

   - **Function:** Provides end-to-end communication services and manages data transfer.
   - **Protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

4. **Application Layer**
   - **Function:** Provides network services and interfaces for user applications.
   - **Protocols:** HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System), Telnet, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).

## Comparison

### OSI Model

- **Layers:** 7
- **Purpose:** Conceptual framework for understanding network communication.
- **Focus:** Detailed, theoretical approach to protocol functions and interactions.

### TCP/IP Model

- **Layers:** 4
- **Purpose:** Practical framework for implementing and understanding internet protocols.
- **Focus:** Streamlined, real-world implementation of network communication.

## Summary

- **OSI Model** is more detailed with 7 layers and serves as a theoretical framework to understand network communication.
- **TCP/IP Model** is more practical with 4 layers and is used for real-world internet communication and protocol implementation.

Both models serve to organize and understand network functions but differ in their approach and level of detail.
