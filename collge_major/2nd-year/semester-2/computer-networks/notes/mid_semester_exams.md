# Computer Networks: Key Concepts

## 1. Phishing

**Definition:**
Phishing is a cyber crime attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.

**Usage in Computer Networks:**

- **How It Works:** Attackers send deceptive emails or messages that appear to come from legitimate sources. These messages often contain links to fake websites that look like real ones, where victims are prompted to enter confidential information.
- **Purpose:** To steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or financial data, leading to identity theft or unauthorized access.
- **Example:** An email that pretends to be from a bank requesting the recipient to verify their account details by clicking a link.

## 2. Botnet

**Definition:**
A botnet is a network of compromised computers, controlled remotely by a malicious actor, which are infected with malware allowing external control.

**Usage in Computer Networks:**

- **How It Works:** Malware infects multiple devices, turning them into "bots" that are controlled by a central command and control server. These bots can perform various malicious activities as directed by the attacker.
- **Purpose:** Botnets are used for various cybercriminal activities, including launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, sending spam, or stealing data.
- **Example:** A DDoS attack that floods a website with traffic from a botnet of thousands of infected devices.

## 3. Simplex

**Definition:**
Simplex is a one-way communication method where data is transmitted in only one direction from sender to receiver.

**Usage in Computer Networks:**

- **How It Works:** Data flows unidirectionally from one device to another without any feedback or response from the receiving device.
- **Purpose:** Useful in scenarios where data needs to be broadcast without requiring acknowledgment or response from the receiver.
- **Example:** Radio broadcasts where the radio station transmits content to listeners who cannot send feedback.

## 4. Half-Duplex

**Definition:**
Half-duplex is a communication mode where data transmission can occur in both directions, but not simultaneously. Only one party can transmit at a time while the other listens.

**Usage in Computer Networks:**

- **How It Works:** Devices take turns transmitting and receiving data. When one device is sending data, the other device must wait until transmission is complete before sending a response.
- **Purpose:** Suitable for situations where bidirectional communication is needed but simultaneous exchange is not required.
- **Example:** Walkie-talkies, where one person speaks while the other listens, and they switch roles to communicate.

## 5. Full-Duplex

**Definition:**
Full-duplex is a communication method where data can be transmitted and received simultaneously in both directions.

**Usage in Computer Networks:**

- **How It Works:** Both devices involved in communication can send and receive data at the same time, leading to more efficient and faster communication.
- **Purpose:** Ideal for scenarios requiring real-time, bidirectional communication.
- **Example:** Telephone calls where both parties can speak and listen simultaneously, allowing for an uninterrupted conversation.
