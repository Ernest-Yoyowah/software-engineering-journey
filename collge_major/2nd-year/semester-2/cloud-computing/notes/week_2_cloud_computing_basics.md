# Week 2: Cloud Computing Basics

## Introduction

### Definition

- **Cloud Computing**: The delivery of computing services over the internet, providing scalable and on-demand access to resources like servers, storage, and applications.

### Properties & Characteristics - Principles

- **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can provision resources as needed.
- **Broad Network Access**: Accessible from various devices over the network.
- **Resource Pooling**: Resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers.
- **Rapid Elasticity**: Resources can be scaled up or down quickly.
- **Measured Service**: Usage is monitored and billed accordingly.

### Service Models

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Offers hardware and software tools over the internet.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Delivers software applications over the internet.

### Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet.
- **Private Cloud**: Services maintained on a private network.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds.
- **Community Cloud**: Shared infrastructure for a specific community.

## Importance

- **Relevance**: Understanding these basics is crucial for effectively leveraging cloud technologies and choosing appropriate cloud services for different needs.
