# Logic Functions Overview

In its basic form, logic involves human reasoning that concludes a proposition is true under certain conditions. Propositions can be categorized as true or false. Digital circuits, with their two-state characteristics, are applicable in logic.

## Propositional Statements

- A proposition is true if certain conditions are true.
- Propositions can be combined to form logic functions.
- Example: "The light is on" is true if "The bulb is not burned out" and "The switch is on" are true.

## George Boole and Boolean Algebra

- George Boole developed a mathematical system for logic statements using symbols.
- Boolean algebra is applied in designing and analyzing digital systems.

## Basic Logic Functions

- **NOT Function:**
  - Inverts the logic level (0 to 1 or 1 to 0).
  - Implemented by an inverter circuit.
- **AND Function:**
  - Outputs high only when all inputs are high.
  - Implemented by an AND gate circuit.
- **OR Function:**
  - Outputs high when any input is high.
  - Implemented by an OR gate circuit.
- Each function responds uniquely to a given set of conditions.

## Combinations and Complex Functions

- **Combination of Basic Functions:**
  - AND, OR, and NOT can be combined to form more complex logic functions.
- **Examples of Complex Functions:**
  - Comparison, arithmetic, code conversion, encoding, decoding, data selection, counting, and storage.

## Digital Systems

- A digital system comprises individual logic functions arranged to perform specific operations or produce defined outputs.

This overview provides insight into important logic functions and their application in digital systems.
