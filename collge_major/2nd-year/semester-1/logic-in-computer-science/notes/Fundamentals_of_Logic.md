# Fundamentals of Logic

Logic is the science of thinking correctly.

Logic was first studied by Aristotle over 2000 years ago but it has become more ordered and well defined since then.
The most widely known set of rules are the syllogisms, where one thing leads to another. The rule is if both premises are true then the conclusion is also true.

## Examples of syllogism:

- Premise1: All rabbits have fur.
- Premise 2: Some pets are rabbits.
- Conclusion: Some pets have fur.

- Premise1: All humans have heart.
- Premise 2: Ernest is a human
- Conclusion: Ernest have heart.

## Stetement

A statement is a declarative sentence that can be true or false or a statement is a sentence which declare something. A statement can be true (when it declares something that does actually exist) or false (when it declares something that does not exist) but cannot be both.

### Examples of statement

- February has 30 days.
- Tomorrow is Thursday
- Milk is white.
- Humans are just fish with legs.
- 4+5 = 10
- Dogs have 8 legs.
- 32 is even

NB: All these are examples of statement since some are true whilst some are false.

## Not Statements

Note that questions and instructions/commands are not statements because they cannot be given a truth value.

### Examples of Not statement

- Have you done it?
- Turn the computer off.
- Stop the bus.
- Tell me the time.

## Propositions

Propositions is the meaningful content of a statement. A proposition can be simple or complex

#### Examples of simple propositions which can either be true or false statement:

- Dogs are mammals
- Kate is a beautiful girl
- Laptops are expensive
- Roses are red
- All cars have engine.

#### Examples of complex propositions:

- Dogs are mammals and cats are mammals.
- Either you like chicken or you like fish.
- I may come there or come later.

Note that what is connecting the two sentences are what we call connectives.

## Connectives

Connectives are language of the propositional logic such as:

- ∧ and (or conjuction)
- ∨ or (disjunction)
- ¬ not (∼) Negation
- ⇒ implies (or conditional) meaning if a proposition then another proposition
- ⇔ biconditional/ equivalence ie if and only if (iff)
- ⊕ Exclusive or
