# Fundamentals of Logic

Logic is the science of thinking correctly.

Logic was first studied by Aristotle over 2000 years ago but it has become more ordered and well defined since then.
The most widely known set of rules are the syllogisms, where one thing leads to another. The rule is if both premises are true then the conclusion is also true.

## Examples of syllogism:

- Premise1: All rabbits have fur.
- Premise 2: Some pets are rabbits.
- Conclusion: Some pets have fur.

- Premise1: All humans have heart.
- Premise 2: Ernest is a human
- Conclusion: Ernest have heart.

## Stetement

A statement is a declarative sentence that can be true or false or a statement is a sentence which declare something. A statement can be true (when it declares something that does actually exist) or false (when it declares something that does not exist) but cannot be both.

## Examples of statement

- February has 30 days.
- Tomorrow is Thursday
- Milk is white.
- Humans are just fish with legs.
- 4+5 = 10
- Dogs have 8 legs.
- 32 is even

NB: All these are examples of statement since some are true whilst some are false.
