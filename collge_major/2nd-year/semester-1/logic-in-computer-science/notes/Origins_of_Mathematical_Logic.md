# The Origins of Mathematical Logic

Logic formalizes valid methods of reasoning. The ancient Greeks began the study of logic, emphasizing reasoning and language use in education. Alongside rhetoric and grammar, logic was part of the trivium, the foundational subjects for young learners. Rules of logic were categorized and named, with syllogisms being one of the most well-known forms.

## What is a Syllogism:

Syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning that consists of two premises and a conclusion. It typically follows a specific structure:

Major Premise: A general statement or principle.
Minor Premise: A specific statement related to the major premise.
Conclusion: A logical inference drawn from the major and minor premises.

## Example of a Syllogism:

- Premise: All rabbits have fur.
- Premise: Some pets are rabbits.
- Conclusion: Some pets have fur.

Formalization of logic became necessary to address flaws in reasoning expressed in natural language. Mathematicians in the nineteenth century began formalizing logic to clarify the foundations of mathematics, spurred by discoveries like non-Euclidean geometries.

### Key Questions Investigated:

- Consistency: Is it impossible to prove both a formula and its negation in a logical system?
- Independence: Are the axioms of a logical system independent?
- Soundness: Are all theorems proved in the logical system true?
- Completeness: Can all true statements be proved in the logical system?

In the first half of the twentieth century, logic became a prominent topic in modern mathematics through Hilbert's program, aiming to axiomatize mathematics while ensuring consistency and completeness. However, Kurt GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem showed that this goal cannot be fully achieved.

In the latter half of the twentieth century, mathematical logic found applications in computer science, becoming one of its foundational theoretical aspects. New systems of logic were developed to address problems in computer science, expanding the scope beyond classical systems.
