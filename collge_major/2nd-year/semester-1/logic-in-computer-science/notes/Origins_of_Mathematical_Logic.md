# The Origins of Mathematical Logic

Logic formalizes valid methods of reasoning. The ancient Greeks began the study of logic, emphasizing reasoning and language use in education. Alongside rhetoric and grammar, logic was part of the trivium, the foundational subjects for young learners. Rules of logic were categorized and named, with syllogisms being one of the most well-known forms.

## What is a Syllogism:

Syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning that consists of two premises and a conclusion. It typically follows a specific structure:

Major Premise: A general statement or principle.
Minor Premise: A specific statement related to the major premise.
Conclusion: A logical inference drawn from the major and minor premises.

## Example of a Syllogism:

- Premise: All rabbits have fur.
- Premise: Some pets are rabbits.
- Conclusion: Some pets have fur.

Formalization of logic became necessary to address flaws in reasoning expressed in natural language. Mathematicians in the nineteenth century began formalizing logic to clarify the foundations of mathematics, spurred by discoveries like non-Euclidean geometries.

### Key Questions Investigated:

- Consistency: Is it impossible to prove both a formula and its negation in a logical system?
- Independence: Are the axioms of a logical system independent?
- Soundness: Are all theorems proved in the logical system true?
- Completeness: Can all true statements be proved in the logical system?

In the first half of the twentieth century, logic became a prominent topic in modern mathematics through Hilbert's program, aiming to axiomatize mathematics while ensuring consistency and completeness. However, Kurt GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem showed that this goal cannot be fully achieved.

In the latter half of the twentieth century, mathematical logic found applications in computer science, becoming one of its foundational theoretical aspects. New systems of logic were developed to address problems in computer science, expanding the scope beyond classical systems.

## Key Terms:

### Trivium:

The "Trivium" is the backbone of a Classical Education and consists of three essential stages of learning.

1. **Grammar Stage**: This is the first phase where young children acquire basic knowledge.

2. **Logic Stage**: The second phase is for teenagers, focusing on understanding and reasoning skills.

3. **Rhetoric Stage**: In the final phase, young adults develop wisdom and the ability to communicate persuasively.

### Rhetoric:

Rhetoric is the art of persuasive communication, encompassing the use of language to influence or persuade an audience.
It's all about being able to speak and write in a way that convinces people to agree with you. In the Trivium, rhetoric means learning how to use words effectively when you talk in public, write essays, or have debates. It's about getting your message across clearly and persuasively.

### Non-Euclidean Geometries:

Non-Euclidean geometries are different ways of thinking about shapes and space that don't follow the rules set out by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. These geometries explore different possibilities for how space can be organized and measured, challenging the traditional ideas of geometry.

### Axioms:

Axioms are basic rules or statements that are accepted as true without needing to be proven. They form the foundation of mathematical theories and systems by providing starting points for reasoning. In geometry, axioms are fundamental principles about points, lines, and shapes that are assumed to be true.

### Axiomatize:

Axiomatize means to create a system of rules or principles (axioms) that define a particular area of study, such as mathematics or logic. It involves organizing the fundamental concepts and assumptions into a coherent and consistent framework, laying the groundwork for further exploration and development in that field.
