# Effectiveness of a Data Communication System

The effectiveness of a data communication system is crucial for successful information exchange. It is determined by factors such as speed, accuracy, reliability, and scalability. A well-designed system ensures efficient communication, minimizing errors and delays.

# Characteristics of Data Communication

1. **Accuracy:** The system must deliver accurate data without errors or corruption.
2. **Speed:** The rate at which data is transmitted, measured in bits per second (bps).
3. **Reliability:** The system's ability to consistently perform and deliver data without failures.
4. **Scalability:** The system should handle increasing amounts of data and users without significant degradation.

# Components of Data Communication

1. **Message:** The information or data to be transmitted.
2. **Sender:** Initiates the communication process.
3. **Receiver:** The destination of the transmitted data.
4. **Transmission Medium:** The physical path through which data travels.
5. **Protocol:** Rules and conventions governing communication.

# Data Representation

Data can be represented in various forms, including analog and digital. Digital data, composed of discrete elements, is commonly used in computer systems due to its reliability and ease of processing.

# Data Flow (Simplex, Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex)

1. **Simplex:** Data flows in one direction only (e.g., TV broadcast).
2. **Half-Duplex:** Data flows in both directions, but not simultaneously (e.g., walkie-talkies).
3. **Full-Duplex:** Data flows in both directions simultaneously (e.g., telephone conversation).

# Data Communication vs Network

- **Data Communication:** Focuses on the exchange of data between two devices.
- **Network:** Involves the interconnection of multiple devices, enabling communication and resource-sharing.

# Networks and How They Work

- A network connects multiple devices, allowing them to communicate and share resources.
- Communication is facilitated by protocols and involves data transmission through various mediums.

# Network Switch

A network switch is a device that connects multiple devices within a local network, forwarding data based on MAC addresses. It operates at the data link layer of the OSI model.

# Network Criteria - Performance, Reliability, Security

1. **Performance:** Measures the efficiency and speed of data transmission.
2. **Reliability:** Ensures consistent and error-free communication.
3. **Security:** Protects data from unauthorized access and ensures confidentiality.

# Types of Connection - Point-to-Point, Multipoint

1. **Point-to-Point:** Direct communication between two devices.
2. **Multipoint:** Communication between a central hub and multiple devices.

# Physical Topology, Types

1. **Bus:** Devices share a common communication path.
2. **Ring:** Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
3. **Star:** Devices are connected to a central hub.
4. **Mesh:** Devices are interconnected, providing redundancy.

# Network Types - LAN, WAN

- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Covers a small geographical area.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Spans a larger geographical area, connecting LANs.

# Connecting WANs - The Internet

- The Internet connects WANs globally, enabling worldwide communication.
- Telecommunication companies, such as Vodafone, provide the infrastructure.

# Switching - Circuit Switch Network, Packet Switch Network

1. **Circuit Switch Network:** Dedicated communication path for the duration of the session.
2. **Packet Switch Network:** Data is divided into packets, transmitted independently, and reassembled at the destination.

# Packets

- Packets are units of data that carry information, along with headers containing routing details.

# The Internet

- A global network of interconnected devices using standard Internet Protocol (IP).
- Enables various services, including email, web browsing, and file transfer.

# Ghana's Internet Connection

- Ghana connects to the internet through undersea cables, such as the one near Nungua.

# Accessing the Internet

- Internet access methods include telephone networks, cable networks, wireless connections, and direct connections.
