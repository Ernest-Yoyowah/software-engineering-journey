## MICROPROCESSORS

### Introduction to Microprocessors

A **microprocessor** is an integrated circuit containing the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer or digital device. It performs basic arithmetic, logic, and input/output operations necessary for computer functioning.

- **Components:** A microprocessor is a complete processing unit on a single chip, containing all necessary components for executing instructions and operations.
- **Speed and Performance:** Measured by clock speed, indicating the rate at which operations are performed.

### 8086 Microprocessor

The 8086 microprocessor, designed by Intel in the late 1970s, is an 8-bit/16-bit microprocessor and the first member of the x86 family.

- **Architecture:** Based on Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC), supporting a wide range of instructions.
- **Address Bus:** 20-bit address bus, addressing up to 1 MB of memory.
- **Data Bus:** 16-bit data bus, transferring data between microprocessor, memory, or I/O devices.

### Key Terms

- **Bit:** Single binary digit.
- **Word:** Basic data size processed by the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) of the processor.
- **Bus:** Group of wires carrying similar information.
- **System Bus:** Communication lines between microprocessor and peripherals.
- **Address Bus:** Carries unique binary patterns to identify memory locations or I/O ports.
- **Data Bus:** Transfers data between memory/processor or I/O device/processor.
- **Control Bus:** Carries control signals for memory/I/O device selection, data transfer direction, and synchronization.

## Basics of Microprocessor

- **Functionality:** Executes instructions in machine language, performing arithmetic, logical operations using the Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU).
- **Data Movement:** Allows data movement between locations.
- **Program Counter (PC):** Stores the address of the next instruction, facilitating jumps and decision-making.

### Features and Applications

- **High Speed:** Executes millions of instructions per second.
- **Low Cost:** Reduced cost due to integrated circuit technology.
- **Reliability:** Semiconductor technology reduces chances of failure.
- **Portability:** Small size and low power consumption make microprocessors portable.
- **Versatility:** Used for various purposes due to their versatility.
- **Small Size:** Miniaturization through very large scale and ultra-large scale integration technology.

### Applications

- Used in calculators, traffic lights, control data, accounting systems, games machines, radars, satellites, flights, etc.

### CPU vs Microprocessors

- **CPU:** Central processing unit found in desktop and laptop computers.
- **Microprocessors:** Smaller, specialized CPUs used in embedded systems and devices.
- **Comparison:** CPU performs a wide range of tasks, whereas microprocessors are designed for specific functions.

### Types of Microprocessors

- **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer):** Supports complex instructions, fewer registers. Examples include Intel x86 CPUs, Motorola 68000.
- **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer):** Simplified instructions, more registers. Examples include ARM, MIPS, Power Architecture.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **CISC Advantages:** Reduced code size, more memory-efficient.
- **CISC Disadvantages:** Slower execution, more complex design, higher power consumption.
- **RISC Advantages:** Simpler instructions, faster execution, lower power consumption.
- **RISC Disadvantages:** More instructions required, increased memory usage, higher cost.
