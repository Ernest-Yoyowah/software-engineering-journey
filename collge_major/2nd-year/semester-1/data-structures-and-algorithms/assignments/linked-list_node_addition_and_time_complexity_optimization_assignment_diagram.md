## Linked List Addition Algorithm Diagram

```diagram
- Create nodes using the given pointers [9, 1, 0, 11, 8, 6] and data [10, 47, 7, 28, 3, 32].
- Connect the nodes to form a linked list.

  (head)     data pointer
    |         |    |
    v         v    v
  +---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+
  | 9 | --> | 10| 1 | --> |47 | 0 | --> | 7 |11 | --> |28 | 8 | --> | 3 | 6 | --> |32 | \ |

Addition at Tail Node (cost = O(n)):
-------------------------------------

- Perform addition (13, 72) at the tail node.

  +---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+
  | 9 | --> | 10| 1 | --> |47 | 0 | --> | 7 |11 | --> |28 | 8 | --> | 3 | 6 | --> |32 |13 | --> |72 | \ |
  +---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+

Optimized Addition at Tail Node (cost = O(1)):
----------------------------------------

- Optimize the addition process to achieve O(1) for the same node.

  +---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+
  |13 | --> | 72| 9 | --> |10 | 1 | --> |47 | 0 | --> | 7 |11 | --> |28 | 8 | --> | 3 | 6 | --> |32 | \ |
  +---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+     +---+---+
