# Algorithm: Array Data Structure Implementation

## Step 1: Accept Input

1. Initialize an empty array A of size 4.
2. Prompt the user to enter four numbers.
3. For each number entered by the user:
   - Read the number and store it in the next available index of array A.

## Step 2: Display Numbers in Original Order

1. Print "Numbers in the order they were entered:".
2. For each number in array A:
   - Print the number.
   - If the number is not the last number in array A, print ", ".

## Step 3: Display Numbers in Reverse Order

1. Print "Numbers in reverse order:".
2. For each number in array A (starting from the last element and moving backwards):
   - Print the number.
   - If the number is not the first number in array A, print ", ".

## Step 4: End

1. End of algorithm.
