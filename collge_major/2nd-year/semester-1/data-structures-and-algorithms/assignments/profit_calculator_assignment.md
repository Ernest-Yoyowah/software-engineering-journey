# Pencil Selling Price Problem

## Question:

A man bought a box of pencils for 30 GHS. If the box contains 24 pencils, determine the selling price of one pencil that would result in a profit.

## Situation:

A man bought a box of pencils for 30 GHS. The box contains 24 pencils.

## Task:

Determine the selling price of one pencil that would result in a profit.

## Action:

1. **Identify Key Information:**

   - Cost of the box of pencils = 30 GHS
   - Number of pencils in the box = 24

2. **Define the Goal:**

   - Find the selling price per pencil for a profit.

3. **Consider Cost and Profit:**

   - Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price

4. **Set Up Equations:**

   - Let's represent the selling price as SP and the cost price as CP.
   - Total Cost Price (TCP) = Cost per pencil \* Number of pencils
   - Profit = SP - CP

5. **Equations:**

   - TCP = CP \* 24
   - Profit = SP - 30

6. **Solve the Equations:**

   - Calculate TCP using the given cost of the box.
   - Choose a reasonable profit margin and calculate SP.
   - Calculate CP by rearranging the equation: CP = TCP / 24

7. **Example Calculation:**
   - If we want a profit of 10 GHS, then TCP = 40 GHS
   - SP = Profit + CP

## Result:

The selling price per pencil that would result in a profit can be calculated based on the chosen profit margin.

## Sample Selling Price:

### Given Information:

- Cost of the box of pencils: 30 GHS
- Number of pencils in the box: 24
- Chosen Profit Margin: 10 GHS

### Calculation:

1. **Calculate Cost Per Pencil (CP):**

   - TCP = CP \* 24
   - CP = TCP / 24
   - CP = 40 / 24
   - CP = 1.67 GHS per pencil

### Result:

The selling price per pencil that would result in a profit of 10 GHS, is 1.67 GHS.

### Reflection:

Reflect on the calculated selling price and the chosen profit margin. You can consider adjusting the profit margin based on different scenarios or business strategies.
