# Data Structures Overview

Data structures are fundamental building blocks used to organize and store data efficiently.

## Arrays

An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element can be accessed by its index.

## Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a data element and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

## Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

## Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue.

- Linear Queue
- Circular Queue
- Priority Queue

## Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a parent node and zero or more child nodes.

- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- B-Trees
- Heaps (Binary Heap, Fibonacci Heap)

## Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected.

- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph
- Weighted Graph
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

## Hash Tables

A hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, where keys are mapped to values using a hash function.

- Separate Chaining
- Open Addressing (Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing)

Data structures play a crucial role in computer science and are used extensively in various applications, from databases and operating systems to algorithms and software development.
