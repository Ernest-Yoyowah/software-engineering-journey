## What is Data Type?

A data type is a set of data with predefined values, such as integers, floating points, characters, strings, etc.

Two main types of data types:

- System-defined data types (Primitive data types) e.g., int, float, char, double, bool
- User-defined data types, like structures in C/C++ and classes in Java.

## What is Data Structure?

A data structure is a representation of data and the operations allowed on that data. It is a way to store and organize data to facilitate access and modifications. Data structures are methods of representing logical relationships between individual data elements for solving specific problems.

## Basic Data Structure

### Linear Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues

### Non-Linear Data Structures

- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
