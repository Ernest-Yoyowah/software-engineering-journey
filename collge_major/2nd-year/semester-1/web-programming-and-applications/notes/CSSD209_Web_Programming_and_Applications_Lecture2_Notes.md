# CSSD209 Web Programming and Applications Lecture 2 Notes

## About WWW as a Protocol

- **Protocol (Standard Way of Communicating):** The World Wide Web (WWW) operates on a protocol, which is a standardized way of communication. This ensures consistency and interoperability across different systems.

- **Every Web Document/Page Requires a WWW Protocol:** Each web document or page is accessed and communicated using a specific WWW protocol. This protocol defines how information is transmitted over the internet.

## Web Server

- **Web Documents Require a Web Server:** In the context of the WWW, web documents (such as HTML, PHP, etc.) need a web server to be hosted and made accessible on the internet.

- **Internet Service Providers:** These are organizations that provide internet connectivity to users. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) enable users to access the WWW.

- **W3C at MIT:** The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and plays a significant role in developing and maintaining web standards.

- **Summary of Web Terminologies:** Understanding key terminologies like Data Transmission, Web Application, HTTP Server, Apache HTTP Server (Xampp), Apache Tomcat Server, HTTP Client (Browsers like Chrome, Safari), Database (MySQL, SQL, etc.), Client-side Programs (HTML, JavaScript, Flash, etc.), and Server-Side (JavaScript, PHP, ASP, C#, Java, etc.) is essential for effective web development.

## URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

## URL Structure

- **URL Components:** A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) has various components, including the protocol (http, https), domain name, port (optional), path (main path, file path), extension name (.php, .html), and query (parameters passed to the server).

- **Domain Name to IP Address:** The domain name is converted into an IP address to locate the server on the internet.

## Client-Server Computing Model

- **The Client-Server Computing Model:** This model involves a client (user's device) making requests to a server (hosting web documents). The server processes requests and sends back the requested information.

## REST API and JSON Format

- **REST API (Representational State Transfer):** It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are commonly used in web development.

- **JSON Format:** JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

## Web Servers and HTTP Server

- **Web Servers:** These are servers responsible for hosting and serving web documents to clients.

- **HTTP Server:** An HTTP server is a type of web server that stores web documents and handles requests from clients. It is fundamental to the functioning of the WWW.
