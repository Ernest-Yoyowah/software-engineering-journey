# How the Internet Works

The internet operates as a global network connecting millions of devices worldwide. Key components and concepts include:

## Clients and Servers

1. **Clients:**

   - Users connecting to the internet for personal reasons.
   - Examples include individuals accessing websites and services.

2. **Servers:**
   - Computers storing webpages, sites, and data.
   - Wait for client requests to provide information.

## Tools and Protocols

1. **Internet Connection:**

   - Provides users with access to the remote world.

2. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol):**

   - Protocols defining how data travels and specifying the destination address.

3. **DNS (Domain Name System):**

   - Serves as an address book for websites.
   - Translates domain names into unique IP addresses.

4. **HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol):**
   - Defines the language for client-server communication.

## Functioning of the Internet

1. **User Request:**

   - A client makes a request, e.g., for google.com.

2. **DNS Lookup:**

   - The browser checks the DNS for the unique IP address of the requested site.

3. **HTTP Request:**

   - The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the webpage.

4. **TCP/IP Communication:**

   - Data communication between client and server guided by TCP/IP.

5. **Server Response:**

   - If approved, the server sends a "200 OK" response.
   - The server sends the webpage in data packets.

6. **Data Packets:**

   - The browser receives and assembles data packets.

7. **Display to User:**
   - The assembled data is displayed to the user.

Understanding these components is fundamental to grasping the intricacies of internet communication.
