# What Are Websites and Webpages

In the digital realm, webpages and websites are fundamental components:

## Webpages:

A webpage is a document displayable on a web browser, typically crafted using HTML and styled with CSS. JavaScript is often employed to add interactivity, while multimedia elements like videos and images enhance the content. Each webpage has a unique identifier known as an IP address, linked to a domain name with a specified file path.

## Websites:

Websites can range from simple collections of static pages to dynamic platforms with complex interactions. The structure and navigation of websites contribute to the user experience, allowing seamless exploration of content.

Understanding the distinction between webpages and websites is essential for comprehending the architecture and functionality of the World Wide Web.
