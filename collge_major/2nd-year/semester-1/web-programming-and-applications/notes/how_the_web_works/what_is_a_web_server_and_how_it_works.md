# What Is a Web Server and How It Works

A web server is a computer dedicated to hosting one or more websites, storing files, and managing data for various purposes such as backups. The core functionalities of a web server include:

## Hosting Websites:

A web server's primary role is to host websites, making them accessible to users on the internet. It stores the files and data necessary for the website's content and functionality.

## Storing Files and Data:

In addition to hosting websites, a web server serves as a storage repository for various files and data. This can include multimedia elements, documents, and databases that support the website's features.

## Responding to Client Requests:

When a user (client) makes a request by accessing a website, the web server processes the request. It responds by delivering the requested webpages or files to the client's web browser. This communication is often facilitated through protocols like HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), defining the language for client-server communication.

Understanding the functions of a web server, including the use of HTTP protocols, is crucial in comprehending how information is stored, managed, and delivered over the internet.
