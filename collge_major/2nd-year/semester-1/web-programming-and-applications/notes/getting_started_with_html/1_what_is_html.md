# What is HTML?

HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It was proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, with the first version released in 1991. HTML is an acronym where "Hypertext" refers to text with links to other texts.

## Historical Context:

- Proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.
- First version released in 1991.

## Purpose of HTML:

HTML serves several crucial purposes in web development:

1. **Structure:** HTML defines the structure of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and more.

2. **Content:** It allows the inclusion of various types of content, such as text, images, videos, and interactive elements.

3. **Semantic Markup:** HTML provides semantic elements that carry meaning, enhancing accessibility and search engine optimization.

## HTML Standards:

- HTML standards are the rules and structure for elements and tags, known as HTML specification.
- Maintained by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).
- Changes in the specification lead to the standardization of new versions.
- The current version is HTML5.

## How HTML Works:

1. **Tags:** HTML uses a set of markup tags enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`). Tags define different elements on a page.

2. **Attributes:** Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are added within the opening tag.

3. **Document Object Model (DOM):** HTML documents are structured as a tree-like hierarchy known as the DOM. Each HTML element becomes a node in this tree.

4. **Browser Rendering:** Browsers interpret HTML documents and render them into the visual web page that users see.

## Basic HTML Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
