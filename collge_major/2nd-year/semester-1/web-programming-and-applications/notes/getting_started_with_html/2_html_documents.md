# HTML Documents

HTML documents form the foundation of web development, providing the structure and content for web pages. Understanding how to create HTML documents is essential for anyone entering the world of web development.

## Structure of an HTML Document:

An HTML document typically consists of the following elements:

1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>` Declaration:**

   - Specifies the document type and version of HTML being used.

2. **`<html>` Element:**

   - The root element that wraps all content on the page.

3. **`<head>` Element:**

   - Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title, character set, and linked stylesheets.

4. **`<meta>` Element:**

   - Specifies metadata, such as character set and viewport settings.

5. **`<title>` Element:**

   - Sets the title of the HTML document, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

6. **`<body>` Element:**
   - Contains the actual content of the HTML document, including text, images, links, and other elements.

## Creating a Basic HTML Document:

Here's an example of a basic HTML document structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First HTML Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is the content of my webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
