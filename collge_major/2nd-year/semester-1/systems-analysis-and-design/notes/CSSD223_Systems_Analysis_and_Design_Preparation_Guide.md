**Difference Between System Design and System Analysis:**

- **System Analysis:** Focuses on understanding and specifying what the new system should accomplish.
- **System Design:** Focuses on how to implement the specified analysis.

**Major Components of System Design and Analysis:**

1. **Problem Definition:**
   - Identifying and understanding the problem to be solved.
2. **Requirements Analysis:**
   - Analyzing and documenting system requirements.
3. **System Design:**
   - Planning and designing the system components.
4. **Implementation:**
   - Developing and deploying the system.
5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Ensuring the system meets requirements through testing.
6. **Maintenance and Evolution:**
   - Addressing changes and updates in the system.
