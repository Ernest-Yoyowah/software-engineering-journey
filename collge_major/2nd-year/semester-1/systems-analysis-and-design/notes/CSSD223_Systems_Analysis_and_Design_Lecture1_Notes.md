# CSSD223 Systems Analysis and Design - Lecture 1 Notes

## Systems

- **Definition:** A system is a collection of components that work together to achieve a common goal.

## Data

- **Definition:** Data refers to raw facts and figures.

## Information

- **Definition:** Information is processed data that is meaningful and useful.

## System Analysis and Design

- **Definition:** System Analysis and Design (SAD) is a process of examining a business situation with the intent of improving it through better procedures and methods.

## Purpose of System Analysis

- The main purposes of system analysis are to identify business needs, find out how they can be met through technology, and define the scope and boundaries of the system.

## Purpose of System Design

- The main purposes of system design are to describe the desired features and operations of the system, ensure that all components of the system work properly together, and guide system construction.

## Why We Need System Analysis and Design

- System analysis and design are essential because they help organizations:
  - Adapt to changing business requirements.
  - Improve efficiency and productivity.
  - Enhance decision-making processes.

## System Requirements

- **Definition:** System requirements include functional and non-functional specifications that the system must meet to satisfy the business needs.

## Project Management

- The Iron Triangle in Project Management consists of:
  - **Scope:** The definition of what needs to be accomplished.
  - **Resources:** The means available to the project, such as money, and people.
  - **Time:** The project's schedule and deadlines.

## Why Some Projects Fail

- Some projects fail due to a lack of:
  - Proper analysis
  - Clear system requirements
  - Adequate design

## Case Study: Heathrow Terminal 5 Project

- Discuss why and how the Heathrow Terminal 5 project failed.

## System Analyst

- Three primary roles of a system analyst:
  - **Consultant:** Advising the organization on technology to help achieve business goals.
  - **Supporting Expert:** Providing expertise in a particular business area.
  - **Agent of Change:** Facilitating the organizational changes required to realize the benefits of a new system.

## Qualities of a System Analyst
