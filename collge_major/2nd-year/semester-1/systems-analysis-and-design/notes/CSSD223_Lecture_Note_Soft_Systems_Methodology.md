# Lecture Note: Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)

## Soft Systems Methodology (SSM):

- **Definition:** Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) is an approach to problem-solving and decision-making that acknowledges the complexity and subjectivity of human systems.
- **Purpose:** It was formed to address complex, ill-defined problems where multiple perspectives and interpretations exist.
- **Expanding Thinking:** SSM encourages individuals to challenge assumptions, explore different viewpoints, and consider the broader context of a problem.

## SSM in Software Engineering:

- **Role:** SSM helps in understanding and addressing complex issues in software engineering, particularly when dealing with:
  - Multiple goals.
  - Different viewpoints and assumptions.
  - Entangled systems with diverse stakeholders.

## SSM Conceptual Models:

- **Model vs Prototype:** A model is a simplified representation of reality, while a prototype is a working version of a system.
- **Use Cases:** SSM conceptual models are useful in areas such as health service delivery, sustainable business practices, youth offender rehabilitation, and drug abuse prevention.

## Stages in SSM:

1. **Entering the Problem Situation:** Identifying and understanding the problematic situation.
2. **Expressing the Problem Situation:** Describing the situation in detail.
3. **Formulating Root Definitions:** Defining the purposeful activity systems involved.
4. **Building Conceptual Models:** Developing models to represent human activity systems.
5. **Comparing Models with Reality:** Assessing the models against real-world observations.
6. **Developing Interventions:** Proposing feasible changes to improve the situation.
7. **Taking Action:** Implementing interventions and monitoring outcomes.

## Key Components:

- **Holons:** Self-contained units or systems within a larger system or a specific part of a huge or complex system.
- **Root Definitions (CATWOE):** A structured approach to defining systems, considering Customers, Actors, Transformation, Worldview, Owner, and Environment.
- **Recent Modifications to CATWOE:** Adaptations to the CATWOE framework based on evolving understanding and applications.

## Outcomes and Applications:

- SSM outcomes include improved problem understanding, stakeholder engagement, and actionable interventions.
- Examples of SSM applications range from organizational change management to public policy development.
