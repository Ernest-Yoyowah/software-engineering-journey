# CSSD223 Systems Analysis and Design - Prevention Strategies

## Preventing Issues in the Heathrow Terminal 5 Project

### Thorough Analysis:

- **Issue:** Inadequate analysis of the existing airport infrastructure.
- **Prevention:** Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the airport, considering both physical and technological aspects. Include a detailed assessment of the impact of the new terminal on existing operations.

### Clear System Requirements:

- **Issue:** Unclear system requirements leading to design flaws.
- **Prevention:** Clearly define and document system requirements at the outset of the project. Involve all stakeholders in the requirement gathering process. Regularly review and update requirements as the project progresses.

### Robust Design Process:

- **Issue:** Logistical issues in the implementation phase.
- **Prevention:** Implement a robust design process that considers all aspects of the project, including infrastructure, technology, and operational procedures. Conduct thorough testing and simulation exercises to identify and address potential issues before implementation.

### Effective Project Management:

- **Issue:** Challenges in managing the Iron Triangle (Scope, Resources, Time).
- **Prevention:** Implement effective project management practices, including regular monitoring and reporting on project progress. Clearly define project scope, allocate resources efficiently, and establish a realistic timeline. Implement a change management process to handle scope changes effectively.

### Stakeholder Communication:

- **Issue:** Negative impacts on the airport's reputation.
- **Prevention:** Establish a robust communication plan that involves all relevant stakeholders. Regularly communicate project updates, milestones, and potential impacts. Address concerns and feedback promptly to maintain positive stakeholder relationships.

### Proactive Risk Mitigation:

- **Issue:** Operational disruptions and baggage handling problems.
- **Prevention:** Conduct a thorough risk analysis at the beginning of the project to identify potential challenges. Develop a comprehensive risk mitigation plan that includes contingency measures for key areas such as technology failures, operational disruptions, and stakeholder concerns.

### Lessons Learned Documentation:

- **Prevention:** Encourage a culture of continuous improvement by documenting lessons learned from each project phase. Use these insights to refine processes, update best practices, and inform future projects.
