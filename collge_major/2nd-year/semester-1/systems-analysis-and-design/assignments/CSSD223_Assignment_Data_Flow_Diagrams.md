# Assignment: Understanding Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

## Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to gain a comprehensive understanding of data flow diagrams (DFD) and their role in systems analysis.

## Tasks:

1. **Learn about Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):**

   - Research and familiarize yourself with the concept of data flow diagrams (DFD). Understand their purpose, components, and how they are used in systems analysis and design.

2. **Modeling Processes with DFD:**

   - Demonstrate how data-flow diagrams can be used to logically model processes within a system. Use examples to illustrate the flow of data between different components and how transformations occur.

3. **Understanding Physical and Logical DFDs:**

   - Explain the differences between physical and logical data flow diagrams (DFDs).
   - Physical DFDs depict the actual implementation of a system, including hardware and software components, while logical DFDs focus on the system's functionality and data flows, abstracting away implementation details.

4. **Role of DFDs in Systems Analysis:**
   - Illustrate how data-flow diagrams serve as tools to support systems analysis. Discuss how DFDs help in understanding system requirements, identifying data flows, defining processes, and mapping interactions between system components.

## Deliverables:

- Prepare a report or presentation summarizing your findings and insights on data flow diagrams (DFD), including explanations, examples, and illustrations where necessary.
- Include diagrams and visual aids to enhance understanding.
- Submit your assignment by [insert submission deadline].
