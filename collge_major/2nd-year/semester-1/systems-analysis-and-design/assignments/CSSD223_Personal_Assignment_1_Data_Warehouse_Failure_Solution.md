# Case Study: Data Warehouse Failure in a Real Estate Group

#### Data Warehouse Failure: Real Estate Group - Rough Solution

#### 1. Why did this system fail?

**Factors that contributed to the failure:**

1. Requirements gathering took 9 months instead of 1 and a half.
2. Incorrect user base estimation: planned for 200, ended up with 2500 users.
3. Late approval process (1 year).
4. Project lasted two years instead of 8 months.
5. Cost escalated to $2.5 million instead of $800,000.

#### 2. Why would a company spend money and time on a project and then cancel it? What could have been done to prevent this?

**Reasons for cancellation:**

- The company canceled the project due to unplanned occurrences (unexpected user base increase) and cost increase. It became too expensive to continue, considering they had spent more than planned.

**Preventive measures:**

- Strong and appropriate project scope to avoid scope creep.
- Confirmation of project approval before development to ensure viability.

#### Data Warehouse Failure: Real Estate Group - Original Solution

**Factors contributing to failure:**

- **Extended Requirements Gathering:**

  - _Issue:_ The requirements gathering phase took nine months instead of the planned one and a half months.
  - _Solution:_ Implement a more streamlined and efficient requirements gathering process. Involve key stakeholders early on and use tools such as prototyping to speed up the feedback loop.

- **Increased User Base:**

  - _Issue:_ The planned user base grew from 200 to 2,500.
  - _Solution:_ Conduct a thorough analysis of potential user growth and scalability requirements during the planning phase. Ensure the infrastructure and design can accommodate a larger user base.

- **Technology Procurement Delays:**
  - _Issue:_ The approval process to buy technology for the project took a year.
  - _Solution:_ Initiate the technology procurement process early in the project timeline. Collaborate closely with procurement departments to expedite approvals.

**Reasons for Canceling a Project:**

1. **Changing Business Priorities:**

   - _Issue:_ The real estate group might have experienced shifts in business priorities, making the originally planned project less relevant.
   - _Solution:_ Regularly communicate with key stakeholders to stay informed about changing business priorities. Conduct periodic reviews to ensure project alignment with current organizational goals.

2. **Budget Constraints:**

   - _Issue:_ Unforeseen budget constraints or financial challenges could force a company to reassess and cancel a project.
   - _Solution:_ Conduct thorough financial planning and risk analysis at the project's initiation. Implement financial controls and contingency plans to mitigate the impact of budget constraints.

3. **Technological Advancements:**

   - _Issue:_ Rapid technological advancements might render the initially planned solution obsolete or less advantageous.
   - _Solution:_ Integrate ongoing technology assessments into the project plan. Be prepared to adapt the project to leverage new technologies or methodologies as they emerge.

4. **Insufficient Return on Investment (ROI):**
   - _Issue:_ The company may realize that the projected benefits or ROI of the project do not justify the ongoing investment.
   - _Solution:_ Establish clear ROI benchmarks at the project's outset. Regularly evaluate progress against these benchmarks and be ready to adjust or halt the project if the expected ROI is not achievable.

**Preventive Measures:**

1. **Comprehensive Feasibility Study:**

   - Conduct a thorough feasibility study before initiating the project to ensure alignment with business goals and assess potential risks.

2. **Continuous Monitoring and Reporting:**

   - Implement a robust project monitoring and reporting system to promptly identify issues and enable informed decision-making.

3. **Flexible Project Planning:**

   - Build flexibility into the project plan to accommodate changes in business priorities, budget fluctuations, and evolving technologies.

4. **Stakeholder Involvement:**
   - Involve key stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle to maintain alignment with organizational objectives and foster a sense of ownership.
