# Predefined Functions in C++

C++ includes a set of predefined functions in its standard library to simplify common programming tasks:

## Input and Output Functions

- `cin`: Reads input from the standard input stream. (Include: `#include <iostream>`)
- `cout`: Writes output to the standard output stream. (Include: `#include <iostream>`)

## Mathematical Functions

- `sqrt()`: Calculates the square root of a number. (Include: `#include <cmath>`)
- `pow()`: Computes the power of a number. (Include: `#include <cmath>`)

## String Functions

- `strlen()`: Determines the length of a C-style string. (Include: `#include <cstring>`)
- `strcmp()`: Compares two C-style strings. (Include: `#include <cstring>`)

These are just a few examples of the many predefined functions available in C++. To use them, include the corresponding headers as mentioned.
