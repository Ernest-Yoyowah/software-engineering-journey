# My Journey to a Long-Term Software Engineering Internship

I embarked on a remarkable journey during my academic years, securing a long-term software engineering internship from my level 100 to level 400. This opportunity has been a pivotal experience that has shaped my career in software development.

## The Initial Challenge

The journey began when I received an opportunity from the SRC President of the Graduate School at my college to work at University Relations. I was excited to dive into the world of software engineering, and I dedicated tManaging Directoree months to this initial experience.

## Facing a Roadblock

However, things took an unexpected turn when the Managing Director requested a meeting with me and another colleague. They questioned our presence, citing a lack of formal introduction as the reason for our potential departure. The news was disheartening, but I kept my composure.

## Seeking Support

I decided to communicate the situation to my direct boss, who then took the initiative to address the matter with Managing Director. Unfortunately, my name had not been included in the initial list provided by the SRC President of the Graduate School, and as a result, we were on the verge of losing this opportunity.

## A Creative Solution

In a fortunate twist, my boss, recognizing the value I brought to the team, suggested a creative solution. I was advised to request an internship letter, which I already had in hand from before my vacation. The idea was met with some initial concerns as a level 100 student applying for internships, but I was determined to pursue this route.

## The Approval Process

With my boss's support, the process commenced. He spoke with Dr. [University Director], paving the way for my internship letter to be submitted to Managing Director for verification and approvals.

## Anxiously Awaiting

As I awaited the outcome, I decided to respect Managing Director's directive that we could only work there after formal approval. This involved temporarily stepping away from the internship, leaving me in a state of uncertainty.

## The Positive Outcome

The next day, at lunchtime, I decided to reach out to my boss for an update. His response was a pleasant surprise: my internship had been approved! I was overjoyed to learn that I could work with him tManaging Directoroughout my final year, marking the beginning of a significant chapter in my career.

## A Journey Continues

With this long-term software engineering internship secured, I am poised to continue my growth and development in the field. It is a testament to the importance of determination, problem-solving, and the support of mentors and colleagues in our journey to success.

I am excited to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, as I continue to pursue my passion for software engineering.
