# My 2023-2024 Software Engineering Journey

In September 2022, right after finishing high school, I wasn't sure about job options. So, I made a smart move—I decided to focus on self-improvement before 2023. I signed up for an online IT course on Coursera called Meta Front End Developer Specialization. It was a big deal because it covered various programming topics, giving me a solid base in software development.

At the same time, I thought, "Why not level up my piano skills?" I started playing for the church back in 2018, but in 2022, I was just an okay player. So, I used this post-high school time to get better before diving into college.

In January 2023, I embarked on a new phase of my journey—the admission process to the Ghana Communication Technology University for the 2022/2023 academic year as a software engineering major. After successfully completing the registration process for freshmen, I eagerly started attending lectures at the main GCTU Campus Tesano.

By February, I joined the Engineering Students Association (ESA-GCTU). This community focused on a practical approach to learning Python, which was cool because it matched the problem-solving vibe of my Meta course. This combo not only shaped my studies but also shaped me personally and professionally.

As April 2023 approached, signaling the vacation period, I secured my first internship as an agile developer at Xcelsz, doing front-end developer stuff in React and CSS and learning a lot about Version Control (Git/GitHub). It was remote from June to August, and man, balancing work, the Meta course, piano practice, and life was a challenge!

After rocking the internship, I headed back to college as the second semester began. Now to wrap up my Meta Front End Developer Specialization. Despite some bumps, I finished strong.

Then came my search for a job or internship. I reached out to the SRC president at the Graduate School, got an invite to join the IT team at University Relations - GCTU. But, uh-oh, the Managing Director wasn't cool with my unofficial status after working there for a while. My boss tried to sort it out, but they wanted a proper intro. So, off I went, getting an internship letter.

Even though folks doubted my level, my boss had my back. Thankfully, I'd applied for the internship letter before the break. I showed it the next day, held my breath, and awaited confirmation. After a brief period of uncertainty, I received the news that my internship had been approved. This marked the beginning of my continued work at University Relations. And here I am on December 30th, still interning, but we're on break.

During this break, I'm diving deep into JavaScript's advanced bits and gearing up for a React Native specialization. Yep, I'm shifting into mobile development. The journey's been tough, but with God, my amazing college prof, mentors, and boss, I'm still standing.

Big shoutout to God for the opportunities and to everyone—college prof, mentors, boss, and other supportive folks—for being my pillars. Merry Christmas to all!
